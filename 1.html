  <p>I think I should write a long body paragraph so I am going to talk about today!
  First, I'm going to eat lunch with my friends. I am so starving right now.
  Next, I am going to try my best to finish this assignment quickly.
  Then, I want to watch movie with my friends!</p>

  <p>Second paragraph is about how I feel these days.
  I quit cheerleading.
  And I am trying to adjust this new life right now.
  for the next two days after I quit cheerleading, everything was tolerable.
  But now as three days pass, I miss my cheerleading life.
  I do not regret quitting, but I miss it.</p>
